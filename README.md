# Harvard CS50P Programming Exercises and Final Project

This repository follows the structure used in Harvard CS50's Problem Sets and projects. It contains a collection of programming exercises and a final project, organized into different directories.

## Exercise Directories

### Week 0: Functions and Variables

This directory contains exercises related to functions and variables.

1. [einstein](0-Functions-Variables/einstein/einstein.py): This program calculates the energy (E) equivalent of mass (m) using Albert Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2
2. [faces](0-Functions-Variables/faces/faces.py): Takes user input, converts it using the convert function, and then prints the converted string.
3. [indoor](0-Functions-Variables/indoor/indoor.py): This program prompts the user to enter a string, stores it in the variable 'indoor,' and then prints the lowercase version of the entered string
4. [playback](0-Functions-Variables/playback/playback.py): This program takes a user-input string, removes spaces from it, and replaces each space with "..." in the modified string. The modified string is then printed.
5. [tip](0-Functions-Variables/tip/tip.py): This program calculates the tip amount for a meal based on user input for the meal cost and tip percentage.


### Week 1: Conditionals

This directory contains exercises related to conditional statements.

1. [bank](1-Conditionals/bank/bank.py): This program evaluates a user-input greeting and assigns a numerical value based on specific conditions. It then prints the assigned value with a "$" symbol.
2. [deep](1-Conditionals/deep/deep.py): This program prompts the user to enter their answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything and checks if their input matches one of the expected answers.
3. [extensions](1-Conditionals/extensions/extensions.py): This program prompts the user to enter a file name, processes the input, and determines the MIME type (content type) based on the file extension. It then prints the corresponding MIME type.
4. [interpreter](1-Conditionals/interpreter/interpreter.py): This program prompts the user to enter a mathematical expression in the format 'x operator y', where 'x' and 'z' are integers and 'operator' is one of the four basic arithmetic operators: '+', '-', '*', or '/'. It then calculates and prints the result of the operation.
5. [meal](1-Conditionals/meal/meal.py): This program prompts the user to enter the current time and checks whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner time based on the time entered.


### Week 2: Loops

This directory contains exercises related to Loops statements.

1. [camel](2-Loops/camel/camel.py): This program prompts the user to enter a camelCase string, converts it to snake_case, and prints the snake_case version of the input string.
2. [coke](2-Loops/coke/coke.py): This program simulates a vending machine's coin operation. It continuously prompts the user to insert coins until the amount due becomes zero or negative, and it keeps track of the change owed or additional amount due.
3. [nutrition](2-Loops/nutrition/nutrition.py): This program allows the user to input the name of a fruit and checks if the fruit exists in a predefined dictionary of fruits and their calorie counts. If the fruit is found in the dictionary, it prints the calorie count for that fruit.
4. [plates](2-Loops/plates/plates.py): This program prompts the user to enter a license plate and checks its validity based on specific rules.
5. [twttr](2-Loops/twttr/twttr.py): This program prompts the user to input a string and then removes both lowercase and uppercase vowels (i.e., 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U') from the input string. It prints the resulting string with vowels removed.


### Week 3: Exceptions

This directory contains exercises related to Exceptions statements.

1. [fuel](3-Exceptions/fuel/fuel.py): This program prompts the user to enter a fuel fraction and calculates the corresponding fuel percentage. It then determines the fuel status based on the calculated percentage, which can be "E" (Empty), "F" (Full), or a specific rounded percentage.
2. [grocery](3-Exceptions/grocery/grocery.py): This program allows the user to create a grocery list by entering items one by one. It counts the occurrences of each item and prints the sorted grocery list in ascending order by item name along with their respective counts.
3. [outdated](3-Exceptions/outdated/outdated.py): This program prompts the user to enter a date in various formats and converts it to a standardized 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. It supports two input date formats: 'mm/dd/yyyy' and 'Month dd, yyyy' (case-insensitive month names with or without a comma after the day). The program validates the date components and handles various error cases.
4. [taqueria](3-Exceptions/taqueria/taqueria.py): This program takes taco orders from the user, calculates the total receipt, and prints the receipt when the user is done ordering. It supports a predefined taco menu with item names and prices.


### Week 4: Libraries

This directory contains exercises related to Exceptions statements.

1. [adieu](4-Libraries/adieu/adieu.py): 
2. [bitcoin](4-Libraries/bitcoin/bitcoin.py): 
3. [emojize](4-Libraries/emojize/emojize.py): 
4. [figlet](4-Libraries/figlet/figlet.py):
5. [game](4-Libraries/game/game.py):
6. [professor](4-Libraries/professor/professor.py): 

### Week 5: Unit Test

This directory contains exercises related to Unit Test statements.

1. [test_bank](5-Unit%20Test/test_bank/test_bank.py): 
2. [test_fuel](5-Unit%20Test/test_fuel/test_fuel.py): 
3. [test_plates](5-Unit%20Test/test_plates/test_plates.py): 
4. [test_twttr](5-Unit%20Test/test_twttr/test_twttr.py): 




# WeatherAPI CLI Project

Welcome to the WeatherAPI CLI Project, a part of Harvard CS50's Problem Sets (CS50P).

## Project Overview

This project utilizes the WeatherAPI to fetch weather and temperature information for a specified city. The project includes a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the WeatherAPI in the following ways:

- Fetch the current weather for a specified city.
- Retrieve a weather forecast for a specific date in a given city.

## Getting Started

To get started with the WeatherAPI CLI Project, please follow the instructions in the `Final Project` directory. The `Final Project` directory contains all the necessary code and documentation to run and use the CLI.

## Final Project Directory

The final project can be found in the [Final Project](Final\Project/) directory. Inside this directory, you will find the project code and a detailed README file that provides instructions on how to set up and use the CLI.

Feel free to explore the `Final Project` directory for more information on the project's requirements and usage.
