## Introduction

This project utilizes the WeatherAPI to fetch weather and temperature information for a specified city. The project includes a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to input the city name and choose between fetching the current weather or a forecast for a specific date.

## What Will Your Software Do?

This software aims to provide users with accurate weather and temperature information for a desired city. It can display both the current weather conditions and a forecast, helping users plan their activities accordingly. The project offers the following features:

- Retrieving and displaying current weather information (temperature, weather description, humidity, etc.).
- Retrieving and displaying a weather forecast for a specific date, including average temperature and humidity.
- Allowing users to choose between displaying temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit using the `-i` flag.
- Allowing users to request a weather forecast for a specific date using the `-f` flag.
- Error handling for cases where the city name is invalid or the API key is incorrect.

## How Will It Be Executed?

The software is executed using the command-line interface (CLI) provided by the `project.py` script. Users will run the script followed by the desired city name and optional flags. For example:

    ``sh
    python project.py New York -i -f
    python project.py New York -if
    python project.py New York -i
    python project.py New York -f
    python project.py New York

## Setup

### Libraries Used

This project utilizes several Python libraries to retrieve weather data and manage the application. The following libraries are used:

- **`configparser`**: Used to read the API key from a configuration file.
- **`argparse`**: Used to parse command-line arguments provided by the user.
- **`sys`**: Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
- **`requests`**: Used to make HTTP requests to the WeatherAPI and retrieve weather data.

### API Key

Before running the project, you'll need an API key from WeatherAPI. Follow these steps to get your API key:

1. Sign up on [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx) (if you haven't already).
2. Log in and navigate to your account settings.
3. Copy the generated API key.
4. Create a file named `secrets.ini` in the project directory and add your API key:

```ini
[openweather]
api_key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/code50/105968684.git
   cd Final\ Project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

After completing the setup steps, you can use the project.py script to retrieve weather information for a specified city. Use the command-line arguments to customize the request:

python project.py <city>: Fetches current weather information for the given city.
python project.py <city> -i: Displays temperature in Fahrenheit.
python project.py <city> -f: Fetches weather forecast for the given city.
python project.py <city> -if: Displays temperature in Fahrenheit and fetches forecast.
python project.py <city> -i -f: Displays temperature in Fahrenheit and fetches forecast.

### Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```markdown
- Final Project/

  - project.py
  - secrets.ini
  - requirements.txt
  - test_project.py
  - gitignore
```

project.py: The main script that interacts with the WeatherAPI and displays weather information.
secrets.ini: Configuration file containing the WeatherAPI API key.
requirements.txt: List of required Python packages for the project.
test_project.py: Test file for testing the project functionalities.
.gitignore: File to exclude certain files from version control.

## Testing

To ensure the reliability of the project, testing has been implemented using the `pytest` framework. Test cases are defined in the `test_project.py` file. The testing script utilizes the following libraries:

- **`unittest.mock`**: Used for mocking external interactions, such as API calls, during testing.
- **`pytest`**: Used as the testing framework to define and run test cases.

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest test_project.py
```
